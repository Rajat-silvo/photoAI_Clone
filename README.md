# PhotoAI Clone üì∏‚ú®

This project is a full-stack clone of PhotoAI, a platform where users can train a personalized AI model on their own images. Once the model is trained, users can generate new, high-quality images of themselves in various styles and themes using simple text prompts or pre-defined image packs.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Custom AI Model Training:** Users can upload a set of their photos (conveniently packaged in a `.zip` file) to train a unique image generation model.
* **Personalized Image Generation:** Generate images with your face by providing a descriptive text prompt.
* **Themed Image Packs:** Create batches of images based on exciting, pre-defined themes like "Valentine's Day" or "Millionaire."
* **Secure Authentication:** User management and authentication handled securely by Clerk.
* **Scalable File Storage:** All user-uploaded images and generated content are stored reliably on Cloudflare R2.
* **Monorepo Architecture:** Built with Turborepo for efficient management of the frontend and backend codebases.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This project is a monorepo managed by Turborepo. The codebase is organized into `apps` and `packages`.

* **`apps/web`**: The main user-facing Next.js application.
* **`apps/backend`**: The backend API built with Express and running on the Bun runtime. It handles API requests, database interactions, and communication with the Fal.AI service.
* **`packages/db`**: Contains the Prisma schema, client, and any database-related utilities. It's shared between the `server` and potentially the `web` app if needed.
* **`packages/ui`**: A collection of shared UI components built with ShadCN/UI, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later)
* [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (or your preferred package manager)
* Access keys for Clerk, Cloudflare R2, Fal.AI, and Postgres database URL.

---

## üöÄ Deployment

The application is deployed to two separate services:

* **Frontend (`apps/web`):** Deployed on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**. Vercel provides seamless integration with Next.js for optimal performance and CI/CD.
* **Backend (`apps/backend`):** Deployed on **[Render](https://render.com/)**. Render is used to host the Express.js backend server and the PostgreSQL database.
