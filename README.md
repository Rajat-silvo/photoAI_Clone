# PhotoAI Clone üì∏‚ú®

This project is a full-stack clone of PhotoAI, a platform where users can train a personalized AI model on their own images. Once the model is trained, users can generate new, high-quality images of themselves in various styles and themes using simple text prompts or pre-defined image packs.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Custom AI Model Training:** Users can upload a set of their photos (conveniently packaged in a `.zip` file) to train a unique image generation model.
* **Personalized Image Generation:** Generate images with your face by providing a descriptive text prompt.
* **Themed Image Packs:** Create batches of images based on exciting, pre-defined themes like "Valentine's Day" or "Millionaire."
* **Secure Authentication:** User management and authentication handled securely by Clerk.
* **Scalable File Storage:** All user-uploaded images and generated content are stored reliably on Cloudflare R2.
* **Monorepo Architecture:** Built with Turborepo for efficient management of the frontend and backend codebases.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This project is a monorepo managed by Turborepo. The codebase is organized into `apps` and `packages`.


/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/ 
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/      # Backend Express.js app (powered by Bun) 
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web/         # Frontend Next.js app 
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/ 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db/          # Prisma schema and database configurations 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ eslint-config/ # Shared ESLint configurations 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig/    # Shared TypeScript configurations 
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/          # Shared React components (using ShadCN) 
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json


* **`apps/web`**: The main user-facing Next.js application.
* **`apps/backend`**: The backend API built with Express and running on the Bun runtime. It handles API requests, database interactions, and communication with the Fal.AI service.
* **`packages/db`**: Contains the Prisma schema, client, and any database-related utilities. It's shared between the `server` and potentially the `web` app if needed.
* **`packages/ui`**: A collection of shared UI components built with ShadCN/UI, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later)
* [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (or your preferred package manager)
* Access keys for Clerk, Cloudflare R2, Fal.AI, and Postgres database URL.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/photoai-clone.git](https://github.com/your-username/photoai-clone.git)
    cd photoai-clone
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    From the root of the project, run:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `apps/server` directory and another one in the `apps/web` directory. Populate them based on the `.env.example` files in each respective directory.

    **`apps/web/.env`:**
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
    ```

    **`apps/server/.env`:**
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
    FAL_AI_KEY="your-fal-ai-key"
    CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
    CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
    CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME="..."
    CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCOUNT_ID="..."
    CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL="https://your-public-r2-url"
    ```

4.  **Push the database schema:**
    Make sure your PostgreSQL database is running, then run the following command from the root to apply the schema:
    ```bash
    pnpm db:push
    ```

5.  **Run the development servers:**
    This command will start both the frontend and backend applications concurrently.
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    * The Next.js frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
    * The Express.js backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üöÄ Deployment

The application is deployed to two separate services:

* **Frontend (`apps/web`):** Deployed on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**. Vercel provides seamless integration with Next.js for optimal performance and CI/CD.
* **Backend (`apps/backend`):** Deployed on **[Render](https://render.com/)**. Render is used to host the Express.js backend server and the PostgreSQL database.
